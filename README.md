Spring Data Graph Sample
========================

A simple Spring Data Neo4j example that demonstrates how to create a persist nodes and relationships. It also shows how
to fetch nodes using the index. Fetching the relationship is breaking, as there might be some problem in this
code (perhaps some bug in my code). Not able to figure out the bug, hence posted this on the spring data forum.
